Steps to train this model
=========================

1. Get ADS version: [5af8cbb] https://github.com/neuropoly/axondeepseg/commit/5af8cbb1e782092ac46e0586eca0f827c0eff938
2. Get the data: Available at NeuroPoly lab in duke/projects/axondeepseg/20201016_model_seg_pns_bf/10_model_selected/dataset_training/dataset_patches/20210121_training_gps_01_filtered
3. Run the "02-training_guideline-pns.ipynb" notebook available at NeuroPoly lab in duke/projects/axondeepseg/20201016_model_seg_pns_bf/10_model_selected/notebooks
4. After successfully running all the cells, the trained model file will be saved under the directory: AxonDeepSeg/axondeepseg/models/

Upload on OSF
=============
Add this README.txt file along with the model and zip the folder. 
Model is saved in OSF under the models/ directory. Example:
AxonDeepSeg/models/model_seg_pns_bf.zip
